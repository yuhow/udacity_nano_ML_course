    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. "

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** I choose to use 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest' and 'SVM'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Tree\n",
    "1. Decision Tree is commonly used in lots of field. I find a very interesting application, 'Application of Decision-Tree Induction Techniques to Personalized Advertisements on Internet Storefronts'. This application is using tree induction techniques to generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The output rules then provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store.<br>\n",
    "Ref.: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10864415.2001.11044215\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The decision tree is very easy to understand and interpret when there are few decisions and outcomes included in the tree. Generally, it also make lower cost of calculation. The input data can be continuous values or categorical variables. Decision tree can help people to determine which feature is relatively more important than the others.<br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Roughly, decision tree perform not that good when there are too many outcome to be linked. Besides, more decisions there are in a tree, the less accurate any expected outcomes are likely to be. It's also very easy to overfit the data especially when the tree is too complex. Hence reducing the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances is one way to avoiding such situation of overfitting. <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_(decision_trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. One of the reason why I choose decision tree as one of candidates for this problem is it's relatively simple and I think I am quite familiar with it. Since we current are facing a binay classification question with continuous and categorical input data and also data with non-linear distribution, decision tree can handle these and at least can performance better than the naive predictor, I wish... Of course, you may notice that I also choose 'Random Forest' as another candidate. Then I can have a very directly view of the comparison between the traditional decision tree and ensemble learning of 'Random Forest'. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest\n",
    "1. The application of 'Random Forest' I found is also very interesting. It presents a methodology based on random forests algorithm by which rotating machinery faults can be diagnosed. To be honest, I have never thought that we can apply the technique of machine learning on this field. <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-84628-814-2_82\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are lots of advantages of 'Random Forest':\n",
    "    - efficiently on large databases.\n",
    "    - it can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.\n",
    "    - It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.\n",
    "    - It has methods for balancing error in class population unbalanced data sets.\n",
    "    - It computes proximities between pairs of cases that can be used in clustering, locating outliers, or (by scaling) give interesting views of the data.\n",
    "    - Generally, it's not that easy to overfit the data for 'Random Forest' due to ensemble learning.<br>\n",
    "Ref.: http://amateurdatascientist.blogspot.tw/2012/01/random-forest-algorithm.html <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/111968/random-forest-how-to-handle-overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Just like all the other ensemble learning algorithm, if the underlying weak learners (decision trees) are overfitting. Besides, 'Random forest' have been observed to overfit for some data sets with noisy classification/regression tasks.<br>\n",
    "Ref.: http://amateurdatascientist.blogspot.tw/2012/01/random-forest-algorithm.html<br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The ensemble method is a very powerful technique in machine learning. 'Random Forest' can perform better than 'Decision Tree'. Since we have lots of data and also continuous and categorical variables, it's very fair to use this ensemble method, 'Random Forest', for this problem. It can handle such non-linear features well just like Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SVM\n",
    "1. Just like 'Decision Tree', lots of analyses use SVM as their kernel technique. The reference is an application of support vector machine modeling for prediction of common diseases. It focuses on the case of diabetes and pre-diabetes. <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SVM can effectively constructs hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification or regression. It can handle both continuous and categorical data as long as we make some preprocessing. Besides, it has a regularization parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding overfitting. The kernel trick can be built in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel.<br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24437/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-svm\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SVM only covers the determination of the parameters for a given value of the regularization and kernel parameters and choice of kernel. In other words, SVM moves the problem of overfitting from optimizing the parameters to model selection. Sadly kernel models can be quite sensitive to overfitting the model selection criterion.<br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine <br>\n",
    "Ref.: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24437/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-svm\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The reasons are quite similar to the previous two candidates. Since we have to handle both continuous and categorical data. And also the problem we are facing is binary classification. I think it's quite fair to include SVM as one of our candidates."

If we check the results of training, we then can have much more information. It seems that 'Decision Tree' and 'Random Forest' have higher F-score than 'SVC' on the training. We all know that there is potential risk of overfitting if the model does perfectly fit the training data but does't make a acceptable prediction on the testing. For 'Decision Tree' and 'Random Forest', we can say that both of them are maybe overfitting with default setting. It should be noted that the result of 'Random Forest' is still better than the result of 'Decision Tree' because 'Random Forest' has smaller differences between training and testing than 'Decision Tree'. Relatively, 'SVC' makes less differences between training and testing. <br>\n",

    "The learning algorithm I choose for the final model is 'Random Forest'. It's an ensemble learning algorithm. The basic idea of ensemble is quite straightforward. The combination of learning models (learners) increases the classification accuracy and makes itself more robust. For 'Random Forest', the learner is a 'Decision Tree'. 'Decision Tree' is very easy to understand and interpret when there are few decisions and outcomes included in the tree. Generally, it also make lower cost of calculation and can handle both continuous values or categorical variables of data. But 'Decision Tree' tends to overfit the data, that is, it doesn't generally learn something from the data but just only memorize them. It somwhow can make terrible prediction on those unseen data (testing). Through combining each individual tree into a 'forest', we take all the contributions for each tree into account like 'averaging/voting their results'. The variance among these trees decreases when compared to a single decision tree. And we can then have an overall better model. The following image shows the process of 'Random Forest':\n",

    "The reference below gives us a very naive example. I try to make it much simpler and easier to understand. Here is modified version: Mady has 2 weeks leave from his office. He wants to spend his 2 weeks by traveling to a place where he have never visited before. After surveying some travel magazines, He has some rough pictures of the place he wants to go, which are Japan and Taiwan. But he just can't make a final decision by himself. These two places are attractive to him equally. So he decides to ask his best friend about which place he should visit. Then his best friend starts asking about him some questions like 'what's your best trip?', 'Why is it so special?' or 'Do you like something...balabala?'. Based on the answers which are given by Mady, his best friend starts recommending the place Mady may like and build the decision tree with the answer given by Mady. As his best friend may recommend his best place to Mady as a friend. The model will be biased with the closeness of their friendship. So he decides to ask few more friends to recommend the best place he may like.\n",
    "\n",
    "His friends ask some random questions and each one also recommends one place to Mady. Later Mady consider all the recommendations and calculates the votes. Votes basically is to pick the popular place recommended by all his friends. At the end the high count place where Mady will go.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the recommended place (Target Prediction) is considered by many friends. Each friend is the tree and the combined all friends will form the forest. This forest is the random forest. As each friend asked random questions to recommend the best place visit.\n",

And this feature is directly connected to people's income. It's a very strong feature for prediction and with highest ranking. \n",
    " 2. **education-num**: Generally speaking, people who are more educated relatively have more opportunities to get better jobs. Aurrently, let's define the better jobs as those jobs with higher pay. Although this judgement is not that solid, not all jobs with higher pay can only be taken by those highly educated people. But at least from my experience, this is ture in most instances. So I give this feature second  ranking. \n",
    " 3. **age**: If we are talking about those people working in the same company, the seniority can be one common way to judge people's pay. But we also know the pay of different jobs is also different. The range of pay for different jobs is quite large. By comparing this feature to the previous two features, it's quite fair that it deserves third ranking.\n",
    " 4. **occupation**: Different jobs (should) correspond to different salaries. Originally, I want to give this second ranking. But I just realize that sometime same occupation/job can still have different pay. In Taiwan, people maybe are all engineers in technology companies. But the truth is that pay will be still very different if they are working in different companies. Since we don't really have company information in our data. So I will give this feature fourth ranking.\n",
    " 5. **capital-loss**: Somehow I take this feature into account just because this is also kind of directly connected to people's income. But not like capital-gain is how much a person earns from investing, capital is the difference between a lower selling price and a higher purchase price, resulting in a financial loss for the seller. If people have almost the salaries, less capital-loss means higher probabilities to make greater than \\$50,000. Nevertheless, this feature is more like a concept of subtraction. That's why it's important but only fifth ranking.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model shows a quite different aspect. The five most important features I take are: 'capital-gain', 'education-num', 'age', 'occupation' and 'capital-loss'. The final model chooses: 'capital-gain', 'martial-status', 'education-num', 'relationship' and 'age'. Except of 'capital-gain', which,  only two features 'education-num' and 'age' are in common between mine and final model. But it should be noted that final model also gives a very different ranking than mine. \n",
    "\n",
    "**capital-gain**: Both final model and I choose this feature as the most important feature for prediction. I guess we have the same point of view. People can really earn lots of money once they are really good at investing in stock, bond or real estate. And this feature is directly connected to people's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**martial-status**: I never expect the final model will chooses this feature and even gives it second ranking. Civilians will have higher income if they are married. Maybe this is because most of civilians will find their meaning of life (family, mortgage ...). so they have more motivation to earn much more money. \n",
    "\n",
    "**education-num**: 'Education-num' is also chosen by final model and me, although we rank this feature with different orders. If we further extract more information from the visualization histogram, we can find out that 'martial-status' and 'education-num' have very closed weights. This confirm my point of view for this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**relationship**: Just like 'martial-status', this feature still didn't show on my wish list. With twenty-twenty hindsight, same point of view made for 'martial-status' can still work here. The final model show that a husband will make much more many in a relationship (no sexual discrimination). In most cases of the current world, we do see man will make more money than a woman. A married man will maybe still make more money than a married woman (no sexual discrimination). \n",
    "\n",
    "**age**: We share the same aspect of 'age'. The seniority can be one common way to judge people's pay. But this judgement is not quite solid and still depending on situation. So it deserves only a lower ranking in final model's point of view."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that our final model's performance will suffer from small decreases of F-score (~4%) and accuracy (~1%). I think such trade-off between F-score (or accuracy) and training time is worth to be taken into account. If we can really suffer very small decreases in F-score and accuracy, I will definitely consider using the reduced data as my training set. The following cell shows the running time of different algorithms by using reduced data. We significantly improve the running time of training and testing while slight but acceptable decreases in F-score. In the meantime, it seems that the risk of overfitting is also reduced for all the learning algorithms we used. The difference between training and testing is much smaller than before."
